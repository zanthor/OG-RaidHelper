 SR+ Accumulation 
Each week that you SR the same item, your SR+ increases by 10. If you SR a different item, your SR+ resets. A Raider is able to miss raids without having your SR+ reset, as we know that IRL happens and can conflict at times. SR+ Accumulation is based off of the Previous Raid SR+ Sheet that you most recently attended. 

In the situations where multiple raids are missed, it is a Raider's responsibility to track down their "Previous Raid SR+ Sheet" and reference that, via link, to the Raid Leads & Master Looters.

A Raider is limited to a 2x SR+ max for 40-person Raids, and 1x SR+ max on 20-person Raids.

In the case of Split Play Raiding (Part-Time Main, Part-Time Alt) 1x SR+ per Character not to exceed the aforementioned limitations.

Unless asked by Raid Leadership to stay on a specific character, you must be logged on and present for the fight for which your item drops, in order to accrue SR+ on that item. Intentionally abusing the system will result in SR+ being reduced and/or reset.
