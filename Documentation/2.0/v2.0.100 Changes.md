Fixed sync engine triggering granular repair sessions for small edits that should have been handled by delta sync.

**MessageRouter.lua** — Replaced dead DELTA_BATCH handler (~930 lines):

The `ASSIGN.DELTA_BATCH` handler expected incoming data with a `deltaData.changes` field containing typed domain objects (`SWAP`, `ROLE`, `ASSIGNMENT`, `STRUCTURE`, etc.). However, the only producer — `SVM.FlushBatch()` — sends `{type = "BATCH_UPDATE", updates = [...]}` with generic SVM key-value pairs (`{path, value, metadata}`). The handler's guard check `if not deltaData.changes then return end` silently dropped every batch message. No code anywhere in the codebase ever produced the `changes` format, making the entire 930-line handler dead code.

Replaced with a 4-line delegation to `SVM.OnBatchReceived`, which already existed and correctly handles the `{updates: [{path, value}]}` format that `FlushBatch` actually sends.

**SavedVariablesManager.lua** — Three changes:

1. **Removed structure checksum from REALTIME delta path**: The sender (`SyncRealtime`) was embedding a checksum via `ComputeRaidChecksum` — which deep-copies the entire raid and hashes everything except `assignedPlayers` (raidMarks, assignmentNumbers, role definitions, consumes, classPriority). The receiver (`OnDeltaReceived`) validated against it and rejected deltas on mismatch. Any minor difference in non-structural fields (common after previously dropped batches) caused false "structure mismatch" rejections, which queued repair requests, triggering full surgical repair sessions. Removed entirely — the 30-second checksum poll handles structural integrity independently.

2. **Enhanced `OnBatchReceived` UI refresh**: Added `OGRH_EncounterFrame.RefreshRoleContainers()` and `OGRH_EncounterSetupFrame` refresh calls (RefreshRaidsList, RefreshEncountersList, RefreshRolesList) after successfully applying batch updates, matching the refresh pattern used by the REALTIME delta handler.

**The cascade that was happening:**

```
Admin makes edit → SVM routes to BATCH → FlushBatch sends ASSIGN.DELTA_BATCH
  → Client receives → checks deltaData.changes → NULL → silently drops ✗

30 seconds later → Admin broadcasts checksum poll
  → Client computes local checksums → mismatches found (from dropped batches)
  → Client sends repair requests → Admin initiates full surgical repair session
```

With the REALTIME path, even when batches worked, the embedded `ComputeRaidChecksum` included so much data (raidMarks, assignmentNumbers, etc.) that any prior drift from dropped batches caused false structure mismatches, rejecting good deltas and escalating to repair.

Now: BATCH deltas apply correctly via `OnBatchReceived`, REALTIME deltas apply without a pre-check gate, and the 30-second poll handles any remaining drift through the established repair system.
