Added "Unassigned" filter to the Encounter Planning Players panel role dropdown.

1 file modified:

EncounterMgmt.lua — Three changes:

1. **Dropdown menu item** (~line 1614): Added `{text = "Unassigned", value = "unassigned"}` to the role filter menu. Menu height auto-adjusts via `table.getn(menuItems)`.

2. **Assigned players set builder** (in `RefreshPlayersList`): When the filter is `"unassigned"`, iterates all `encounter.roles[*].assignedPlayers[*]` from the current encounter via SVM and builds an `assignedInEncounter` lookup table.

3. **Filter logic in both source branches**:
   - Roster source: New `elseif selectedPlayerRole == "unassigned"` branch includes players only if not in `assignedInEncounter`, preserving role-bucket section grouping (Tanks/Healers/Melee/Ranged headers).
   - Raid source: Same pattern — includes raid members only if not in `assignedInEncounter`, with role-assignment section grouping.
   - Guild members are excluded when "Unassigned" is selected (same as other specific role filters — only raid or planning roster players shown).

4. **Live refresh on assignment changes**: Added `RefreshPlayersList()` calls at all 4 locations where assignments change so the unassigned list updates immediately:
   - Player list drag-drop onto a role slot
   - Slot-to-slot drag-drop (swap/move)
   - Right-click unassign on a role slot
   - Auto Assign button (`AutoAssignPlayers` function)
