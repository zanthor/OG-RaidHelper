Added version checks to network traffic to avoid compatability issues.

3 files modified:

MessageTypes.lua:12-14 — Added OGRH.SYNC_VERSION = "00" (hex, 00–FF = 256 versions). Bump this when sync wire format or message semantics change.

MessageRouter.lua — Two changes:

Send (line ~113): Injects version into outbound prefix — "OGRH_ADMIN_QUERY" becomes "OGRH00_ADMIN_QUERY" on the wire
Wildcard handler (line ~259): Extracts version from positions 5-6, drops traffic with mismatched version (warns once per sender per session), strips version before routing internally — "OGRH00_ADMIN_QUERY" → "OGRH_ADMIN_QUERY"
Added syncVersionWarned table to State for deduplicated warnings
Permissions.lua — Converted 2 direct OGAddonMsg.Send calls to OGRH.MessageRouter.Broadcast so they go through the version injection path.

How it works:

Old client (v2.0.90, no SyncVersion) sends "OGRH_ADMIN_QUERY" → new client reads positions 5-6 as "_A" ≠ "00" → dropped
New client sends "OGRH00_ADMIN_QUERY" → old client's wildcard checks string.sub(prefix, 1, 5) == "OGRH_" which is "OGRH0" ≠ "OGRH_" → dropped
Two new clients with same version: prefix matches, stripped, routed normally
