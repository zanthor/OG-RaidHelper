Infrastructure dead code cleanup — removed the entire Versioning system and consolidated duplicate utilities.

Full audit documented in `Documentation/2.1/InfrastructureCleanup.md`.

---

### Deleted Files

**`_Infrastructure/DataManagement_v1.lua`** — Legacy data management, superseded by DataManagement.lua. No callers.

**`_Infrastructure/DataManagement_v2.lua`** — Intermediate revision, also superseded. No callers.

**`_Infrastructure/Versioning.lua`** (586 lines) — Entire file dead. Every function either referenced already-removed state, called already-removed functions, or had zero external callers. The version vector / conflict resolution system was never wired into the live sync engine (which uses `SyncChecksum.*` and `SYNC_VERSION` instead). Removed from TOC.

---

### DeepCopy Consolidation

**`_Core/Utilities.lua`** — Added canonical `OGRH.DeepCopy` (the version from SyncGranular.lua that had been live due to TOC load order winning over SyncChecksum.lua's copy).

**`_Infrastructure/SyncGranular.lua`** — Removed duplicate `OGRH.DeepCopy` definition. Now uses the one from Utilities.lua.

**`_Infrastructure/SyncChecksum.lua`** — Removed `OGRH.DeepCopy` wrapper that delegated to the global. `OGRH.SyncChecksum.DeepCopy` (different function with circular-reference protection) left untouched.

### Versioning.lua Removal — Vestigial Code Cleaned From Other Files

**`_Infrastructure/Permissions.lua`** — Removed vestigial `version` field from `ADMIN.TAKEOVER` and `ADMIN.ASSIGN` broadcast payloads. The value was sent but never read by receivers.

**`_Infrastructure/MessageRouter.lua`** — Removed vestigial `dataVersion` field from `POLL_RESPONSE` payload. Replaced `OGRH.ComputeChecksum()` (from Versioning.lua) with `OGRH.SyncChecksum.CalculateAllStructureChecksum()` (the actual live checksum system) in the `POLL_RESPONSE` checksum field.

**`_Core/Core.lua`** — Removed guarded `OGRH.Versioning.Initialize()` call from addon init and `OGRH.Versioning.Save()` call from logout/save handler.

**`_UI/MainUI.lua`** — Removed `/ogrh debug version` and `/ogrh debug changes` slash command branches (called `DebugPrintState`/`DebugPrintChanges` which referenced the now-deleted Versioning state).

**`_Infrastructure/SyncSession.lua`** — Removed dead version-checking section: `UpdateHighestVersion()`, `CheckOwnVersion()`, `ShowVersionWarning()`, `ResetVersionTracking()`. These called `OGRH.Versioning.CompareVersions` which was never actually defined as a namespaced function (no wrapper existed — the calls would have hit nil). Removed `highestVersion` and `versionWarningShown` from `SyncSession.State`. Removed `ResetVersionTracking()` call from `OnRaidRosterUpdate` (rest of that function preserved — handles panel cleanup and admin disconnect detection).
