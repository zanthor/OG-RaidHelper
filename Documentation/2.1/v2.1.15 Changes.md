Fixed class colors missing for imported players who haven't been seen in guild or raid.

**Problem:** Players imported from Raid-Helper JSON or RaidRes showed white (uncolored) names in both the Invite Roster and Planning Roster panels. This happened because:

1. Raid-Helper uses `className` for both actual WoW class AND signup status (`Tentative`, `Bench`, `Absence`, `Tank`, etc.). When className was a status/role, the parser set class to nil and fell back to `OGRH.GetPlayerClass()`, which can't resolve players never seen in guild/raid.
2. RaidRes/RollFor softres data contains class info in the raw decoded JSON, but `GetSoftResPlayers` never extracted it — only name, role, and SR data were pulled from the transformer output.
3. Even when class was known from import data, it was never written to `OGRH.classCache`, so other panels (RosterPanel, RolesUI) that call `GetPlayerClass()` couldn't find it.

### Spec-to-Class Inference (`Invites.lua`)

Added `SPEC_TO_CLASS` lookup table mapping all 30 Raid-Helper spec names to WoW classes (e.g., `Feral → DRUID`, `Protection1 → PALADIN`, `Restoration1 → SHAMAN`). Added `CLASS_EMOTE_IDS` table as a last-resort fallback using Raid-Helper's class emoji IDs.

New `InferClassFromSpec(signup)` function checks three sources in order:
1. `specName` against `SPEC_TO_CLASS`
2. `specName` as a raw class name (handles alt-signup edge cases like `specName: "Warrior"`)
3. `classEmoteId` against `CLASS_EMOTE_IDS`

Applied to all three parser paths:
- **`ParseRaidHelperJSON`** — Tentative, Bench, Absence, and role-as-class signups now resolve class from spec
- **`ParseRaidHelperGroupsJSON` (new format)** — Tank className and any future status classNames now use `InferClassFromSpec` instead of hardcoded Protection/Guardian checks
- **`ParseRaidHelperGroupsJSON` (old raidDrop format)** — Added spec inference for benched players

### Class Cache Population

**`GetSoftResPlayers`** — Extracts class data from `decodedData.softreserves` (the raw raid-res JSON includes a `class` field per player entry that RollFor's `SoftResDataTransformer` discards when regrouping by item). Each player now gets `.class` set from this source.

**`UpdatePlayerClass`** — Now seeds `OGRH.classCache` from `playerData.class` before doing guild/raid lookups, so import-sourced class data is available to all other panels.

**`GeneratePlanningRoster`** — Also populates `OGRH.classCache` for each player with known class, covering the planning roster data path.
